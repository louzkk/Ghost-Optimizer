# Why optimize Windows?
Windows is made to work on any kind of hardware and for any kind of user. This means that it puts usability and stability first, but it also has a lot of extra features, ads, services, and compatibility layers that not every user needs. Even though Windows is well optimized, it gets heavier with each update, and mid- to low-end PCs start to feel the effects. Ghost Optimizer doesn't try to "fix" Windows. Instead, it optimizes it by turning off features and services that aren't being used, blocking most telemetry, and changing system values to prioritize performance, and privacy. The result is a system that is cleaner and more responsive. It won't work magically, but it does help lower background resource usage and make everything run better.

# How Registry Tweaks Work
The Windows Registry (Regedit.exe) is a central database where Windows stores settings for the system, installed programs, and hardware. It controls how Windows behaves, remembers user preferences, and manages hidden features. Accessing the Registry lets you make deeper, more advanced changes to the system’s behavior you can’t do through settings app.
