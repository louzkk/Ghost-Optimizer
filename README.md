# 💜 About
**Ghost Optimizer** is a lightweight open-source tweaker/optimizer that **improves system** **performance**, **network speed**, and **reduces latency**. I also made it to make Windows feel faster and minimal by freeing up unnecessary system resources. The script is text-based but interactive, so you can choose exactly which optimizations to apply or skip.         

> Recommended for low-end, mid-range, or high-end PCs and laptops.
