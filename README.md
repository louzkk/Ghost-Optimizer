# 💜 About
**Ghost Optimizer** is a lightweight, open-source tweaker/optimizer that **improves performance** (FPS), **network speed** (ping), **reduces latency** (input lag), and **disables telemetry**, **data collection**, and **tracking** to **protect your privacy** and **minimize background activity**.  
It also makes Windows feel faster and cleaner by freeing up unnecessary system resources. The script is text-based but interactive, so you can choose exactly which optimizations to apply or skip.

> Recommended for low-end, mid-range, and high-end PCs or laptops.
