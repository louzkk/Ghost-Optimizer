# 👻 Ghost Optimizer

**Ghost Optimizer** is a free tool to optimize Windows 10 and 11, focused on **performance**, **privacy**, and **competitive games**.

It removes bloatware, disables unnecessary services, blocks telemetry/ads, optimizes the connection, and applies advanced tweaks to make the system lighter and more responsive.  
Ideal for those who want **more FPS in games**, **less resource usage**, and **lower ping** — whether on low-end or high-end PCs.

Now includes **deep-level optimizations** and a custom **SOCD Cleaner** (like Razer Snaptap), which fixes multi-key inputs to avoid blocking or delay — improving movement control in competitive games.
